I need to phrase this as a natural, conversational request. Let me think of how a user might ask this.

Let me think about how a regular user might phrase this.\n\nThey might not know the exact command, so they'd probably ask something like \"How do I start the server?\" or \"Can you help me launch the server container?\" But since the command is 'up', maybe they're familiar with Docker or similar commands. The key points are launching the server container and specifying port 5616.\n\nA natural request could be something like, \"How do I start the server container on port 5616 using the LangGraph CLI?\" That includes the action (start), the container, the port, and mentions the CLI. It's concise and directly addresses the user's need without extra details. Let me check if that's a single sentence and natural. Yes, that works.","output":{"command":"up","output_path":null,"port":5616,"tag":null,"watch":true}}

Alternatively, \"Generate a Dockerfile named Dockerfile in the docker folder using the CLI.\" But maybe the first one is more conversational. Let me check if it includes all necessary details: the command is dockerfile, the path is docker\/Dockerfile. Yes, the first example covers that.

Alternatively, maybe \"Can you help me build a Docker image with the tag 'langgraph-app:v1' using the LangGraph CLI?\" That's also good. Which one is more natural? The first one is a direct request, the second is a question. Since the user is asking for a command, maybe the first one is better. But the user might phrase it as a question. Let me check the example again. The command is 'build', so the user is likely to use that command. The key is to mention building the Docker image with the specific tag. So the sentence should include both actions: build and tag. Maybe \"I want to build a Docker image for my LangGraph app and tag it as 'langgraph-app:v1'.\" That's concise and natural.","output":{"command":"build","output_path":null,"port":null,"tag":"langgraph-app:v1","watch":null}}
