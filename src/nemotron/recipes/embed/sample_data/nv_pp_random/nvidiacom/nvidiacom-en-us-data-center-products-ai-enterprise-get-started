FAQs


How can a developer get started quickly with NIM microservices?
Members of the NVIDIA Developer Program have access to self-hosting NVIDIA NIM for research, application development, and experimentation on up to 16 GPUs on any infrastructure cloud, data center, or personal workstation. Access to NIM microservices is available throughout the duration of program membership. For more information, see this FAQ.
What s the difference between open-source software and NVIDIA AI Enterprise?
NVIDIA AI Enterprise consists of open-source software that s curated, optimized, and supported by NVIDIA, as well as exclusive software that isn t open source, such as NVIDIA NIM, NVIDIA Base Command Manager, and NVIDIA vGPU. It provides the benefits of transparency and top-of-tree innovation, as well as security and stability for ever-growing software dependencies. With enterprise support that provides service-level agreements, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an enterprise-grade, secure, and reliable platform to accelerate your AI journey.
How can I purchase NVIDIA AI Enterprise?
You can purchase NVIDIA AI Enterprise through the NVIDIA Partner Network and the cloud marketplaces of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. Contact NVIDIA with your purchasing questions.
How does NVIDIA AI Enterprise deliver security and stability?
NVIDIA AI Enterprise offers different software branches to maintain security and stability for desired software lifecycles, including:
Feature branches: Every AI and data science package is updated monthly with the latest features and security fixes. It s meant for developers who want to deploy into production with the newest capabilities and are willing to update their applications if APIs change.
Production branches: A nine-month lifecycle with monthly security patches and API stability. This is ideal for deploying AI in production when API stability is required.
Long-term support branches: A three-year lifecycle with quarterly security patches and API stability. This is ideal for industries that prioritize long-term software lifetimes.
NVIDIA AI Enterprise customers also receive security advisories and exploitability information from NVIDIA, as well as software bill of materials (SBOM) for software supply chain transparency, and vulnerability remediation guidance with context.
