Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct Overview
Description:
This container houses the Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, which is a multilingual large language model from the Meta Llama 3.1 collection of pretrained and instruction-tuned generative models. This model is optimized for multilingual dialogue use cases and outperforms many available open-source and closed-source chat models on common industry benchmarks. Llama 3.1 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture; the tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.
The container components are ready for commercial/non-commercial use.
