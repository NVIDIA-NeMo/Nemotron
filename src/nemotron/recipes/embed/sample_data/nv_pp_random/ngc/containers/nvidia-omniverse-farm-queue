Omniverse Farm
NVIDIA Omniverse Farm is a system layer that allows users to orchestrate multiple computing resources to execute batch and interactive tasks.
It is both infrastructure agnostic - meaning it can work across typical workstations, VMs, bare-metal servers, or advanced cloud scheduling platforms such as Kubernetes - and task agnostic, able to orchestrate and distribute tasks from rendering, streaming, file conversion, synthetic data generation, to simulation.
Users can leverage Farm in batch mode for ad hoc tasks such as batching rendering or batch file conversion by an arbitrary machine, or cluster of machines, that have been allocated for the specific use.
Farm is designed from the ground up to embrace the microservice architecture for flexibility and scalability.
