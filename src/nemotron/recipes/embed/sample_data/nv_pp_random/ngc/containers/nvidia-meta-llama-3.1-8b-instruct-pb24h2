What Is NVIDIA NIM?
NVIDIA NIM, part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, is a set of easy-to-use microservices designed to speed up generative AI deployment in enterprises. Supporting a wide range of AI models, including NVIDIA AI foundation and custom models, it ensures seamless, scalable AI inferencing, on-premises or in the cloud, leveraging industry standard APIs.
The Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct NIM simplifies the deployment of the Llama 3.1 8B instruction tuned model which is optimized for language understanding, reasoning, and text generation use cases, and outperforms many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks.
NVIDIA NIM offers prebuilt containers for large language models (LLMs) that can be used to develop chatbots, content analyzers or any application that needs to understand and generate human language. Each NIM consists of a container and a model and uses a CUDA-accelerated runtime for all NVIDIA GPUs, with special optimizations available for many configurations. Whether on-premises or in the cloud, NIM is the fastest way to achieve accelerated generative AI inference at scale.
