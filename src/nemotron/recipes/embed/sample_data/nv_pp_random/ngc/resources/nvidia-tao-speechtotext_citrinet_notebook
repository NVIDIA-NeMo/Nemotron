Automatic Speech Recognition
ASR, or Automatic Speech Recognition, refers to the problem of getting a program to automatically transcribe spoken language (speech-to-text). Our goal is usually to have a model that minimizes the Word Error Rate (WER) metric when transcribing speech input. In other words, given some audio file (e.g. a WAV file) containing speech.
The best place to get started with TAO Toolkit - ASR would be the TAO - ASR jupyter notebooks sample enclosed in this sample.
This resource has two notebooks included.
Training: Sample workflow for training an ASR - Citrinet model and export the model to a ``` .riva``` file
Deployment: Sample workflow to consume the ``` .riva``` file and deploy it to Riva.
If you are a seasoned Conversation AI developer we recommend installing TAO and referring to the TAO documentation for detailed information.
