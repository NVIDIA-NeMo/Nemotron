Model Overview
EfficientNets are a family of image classification models, which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, being an order-of-magnitude smaller and faster.
Model Architecture
EfficientNet is an image classification model family. It was first described in EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks. The scripts provided enable you to train the EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B4, EfficientNet-WideSE-B0 and, EfficientNet-WideSE-B4 models.
EfficientNet-WideSE models use Squeeze-and-Excitation layers wider than original EfficientNet models, the width of SE module is proportional to the width of Depthwise Separable Convolutions instead of block width.
WideSE models are slightly more accurate than original models.
This model is trained with mixed precision using Tensor Cores on Volta and the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architectures. Therefore, researchers can get results over 2x faster than training without Tensor Cores, while experiencing the benefits of mixed precision training. This model is tested against each NGC monthly container release to ensure consistent accuracy and performance over time.
We use NHWC data layout when training using Mixed Precision.
