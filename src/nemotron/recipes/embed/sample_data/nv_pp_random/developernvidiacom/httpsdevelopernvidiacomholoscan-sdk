How Holoscan SDK Works
Accelerate sensor data processing with the Holoscan SDK.
NVIDIA Holoscan includes optimized libraries for network connectivity, data processing, and AI. It provides examples for creating and running low-latency, data-streaming applications across industries using C++, Python, or Graph Composer. Using the SDK, developers can build pipelines for sensor data processing that meet latency requirements and scale from the cloud to the data center to the edge.
